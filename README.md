# Roman Numeral Converter
The Roman Numeral Converter is a Python program that allows users to convert between Roman numerals and integers.

In this program, users can choose the mode of operation: Roman to Integer or Integer to Roman.

In the Roman to Integer mode, users can enter a Roman numeral, and the program will convert it to its corresponding integer value. It follows the rules of Roman numerals, considering the order of symbols and the subtractive notation.

In the Integer to Roman mode, users can enter an integer value within the range of 1 to 3999, and the program will convert it to its equivalent Roman numeral. It uses a greedy algorithm to find the largest Roman numeral symbols that can represent the given integer.

The program performs error handling to detect and raise exceptions for invalid input, such as invalid Roman numerals, invalid combinations of symbols, and out-of-range integers.

The Roman Numeral Converter program also includes a welcome page that provides an introduction and instructions for using the program. After performing a conversion, the user has the option to continue using the program or exit by typing "exit()".

This program idea is inspired by the 'Roman to Integer' problem on LeetCode, which challenges users to convert Roman numerals to their corresponding integer values. Leveraging the concepts and rules outlined in the problem, this program provides a user-friendly interface and efficient conversion algorithms to accurately convert Roman numerals to integers and vice versa."
